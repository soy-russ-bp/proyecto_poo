The Arjé project is an initiative aimed at improving opportunities for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities. This project serves as a fundamental step toward developing technologies that transcend barriers, fostering a more connected, inclusive, and fair world.

### Evolution:

The Arjé project has evolved over time. Initially, we had a functional prototype in Python with minimal functionality. This was primarily to understand how Python libraries worked. However, the code wasn't in the object-oriented programming paradigm, lacked scalability, and lacked modularity. As a result, what was initially programmed in Python had to be re-implemented in C# using the object-oriented paradigm and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

([Code in MVC HERE]())

Furthermore, after careful evaluation, we decided to adjust the direction of our project while maintaining the same vision but addressing the problem differently. Although our initial aspiration was to develop a complete translator, we realized that more time was needed to achieve that goal. Therefore, for this stage, ARJE, instead of being an interpreter, will function as a dedicated trainer to teach the [sign language alphabet](). This way, you can ensure effective learning.

Finally, as expected, due to the aforementioned changes, many artifacts had to evolve, such as [functional requirements](), [user stories & acceptance criteria](), and the [class diagram]() (We only draw a representation of the class diagram of the MVC pattern used in our project, the classes of the connection between C# and Python were not drawn, the ones used so that the [MediaPipe Hands](https://mediapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solutions/hands.html) model could be used in C#. The project supports Windows and MacOS.

## Process management

We worked in 2 subteams, because some team members have years of experience in C# development, they were in charge of programming on this occasion, while the other team was in charge of documentation, diagrams, artifacts, presentations, etc. This was done so that the people who did the documentation could have the time to learn C# and program in the third installment supported by the experts who will serve as mentors.
