The Arjé project is an initiative aimed at improving opportunities for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities. This project serves as a fundamental step toward developing technologies that transcend barriers, fostering a more connected, inclusive, and fair world.

## Evolution

---
**Product evolution:**

* First review:

The Arjé project has evolved over time. Initially, we had a functional prototype in Python with minimal functionality. This was primarily to understand how Python libraries worked. However, the code wasn't in the object-oriented programming paradigm, lacked scalability, and lacked modularity. 

* Second Review

What was initially programmed in Python had to be re-implemented in C# using the object-oriented paradigm and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern (It is important to mention that in this installment the view was only part of the command console).

Furthermore, after careful evaluation, we decided to adjust the direction of our project while maintaining the same vision but addressing the problem differently. Although our initial aspiration was to develop a complete translator, we realized that more time was needed to achieve that goal. Therefore, for this stage, ARJE, instead of being an interpreter, will function as a dedicated trainer to teach the Sign Language with IA, in this way, you can ensure effective learning.

* Third Review

"Finally, for this third delivery, we carried out the training of the models. Additionally, we added the view part to the project, transitioning from a console view to a non-functional prototype, and from the non-functional prototype to a UI that is part of the MVC, programmed in the [Avalonia Framework](https://avaloniaui.net/)

---
**Requeriments evolution:**

Between the first and second deliveries, the requirements evolved. We had gained a better understanding of the product and how we would address the problems that arose. That's why, in the [functional requirements](https://github.com/soy-russ-bp/proyecto_poo/blob/Second-Review/docs/Requirements/Functional%20Requirements), we added the system's capability to train and recognize models previously trained within the same system, an aspect that we didn't consider in the [initial functional requirements](https://github.com/soy-russ-bp/proyecto_poo/blob/First-Review/docs/Requirements/FunctionalRequirements.pdf).

**Artifacts evolution:**

The requirements evolved, and as a consequence, the artifacts associated with them did too.

The project supports Windows and MacOS.)

And Finally this is the class Diagram of our Third Review:

## Process management

Process description:

In this section, you'll be able to observe the process we followed in this third delivery until reaching the final outcome. It's worth mentioning that we worked with short sprints, which helped us to have a more agile process. However, there was one week where we couldn't make progress due to an intense academic workload; hence, Sprint 4 commences on December 9th. This section also includes the contribution metrics and the binnacle.

**Sprints:**

* Sprint 1 (Nov 8th- Nov 15th)

We had meetings to define the UI: UI [HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14kQfQ3aziODGgx76l89sQt56on3jFK2E/edit#slide=id.p2). A part of the team began learning Avalonia, the framework for the visual part's programming. In that same sprint, we made progress on the visual aspect (a portion had already been programmed with Avalonia, although it wasn't yet functional). Another segment of the team was focused on learning C# to address their specific issue in the part they were assigned to program.

* Sprint 2 (15th - 22th)

The UI started to become functional; now it could open the camera in the practice section, although there wasn't yet any model available for practice. The team continued trying to address their individual issues, and we sought to improve various aspects of the project, taking into account the teacher's feedback.

* Sprint 3 (22th - 29th)

Several necessary utilities were programmed for the project's operation, such as a sample collector for the AI's functioning, the import section, among other things. We continued improving the UI, ensuring its integration into the MVC structure. Additionally, we held several meetings among team members to define how we would approach the final weeks and allocate tasks to each person in order to successfully conclude the project.


* Sprint 4 (Dec 9th - Dec 13th):

Training the model, preparing the video and a video to "promote the project", and finishing final programming and documentation details.
