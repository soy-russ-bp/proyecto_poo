With this implementation, we have significantly enhanced the user experience by simplifying the import and display of files post-training in our application. The Avalonia UI provides a robust platform for these functions, offering both functionality and aesthetics.

Code documentation is up-to-date, and any new developer can refer to it to easily understand the implementation. Furthermore, thorough testing has been conducted to ensure the resilience of the import functionality.
