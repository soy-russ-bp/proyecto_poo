  <td>"We talked about how we would work; we were advised to write the code in such a way that we could review the code we are producing. We discussed that we already have the first prototype in Python, but it only detects letters, and we intended to detect more than just that. We talked about word extensions and signs. We were assigned the task of considering how extensible, manageable, scalable, etc., the code is, and whether the Python code is truly object-oriented."</td>
  <td>Currently, we have the initial prototype in Python, which, however, only detects letters. Our goal is to expand this capability to include word extensions and signs. As part of our assignment, we need to evaluate the code's extensibility, manageability, and scalability. Additionally, we are exploring whether the Python code adheres to object-oriented principles. Moving forward, we should focus on enhancing the code to meet these criteria and ensuring it aligns with our project objectives.</td>

  <td>16 Oct   </td>
  <td>We discussed about the code and what changes we should make, the project was already in demo mode, however, it was not object-oriented, so that change was suggested to us.</td>
  <td>We will make a hybrid program between the Python language and the C# language, and in the same way, we will make the project more based on object-oriented programming.</td>

  <td>25 Oct   </td>
  <td>We informed the instructor that we had decided to shift from programming in Python to using C#. We had already established the connection between Python and C#, but it was only compatible with Windows. Consequently, we discussed how to make the application compatible with Mac and debated whether this was truly indispensable. The instructor reminded us that the ultimate goal is to reach the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, emphasizing the model and controller aspects for this second delivery.</td>
  <td>Transition to C# for programming, resolve cross-platform compatibility issues between Python and C#, particularly for Mac. Focus on implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, emphasizing the model and controller components. Incorporate feedback received on Monday for code and application improvement. Document all changes and decisions for clarity and future reference.</td>

  <td>1 Nov (Only the team)   </td>
  <td>We were on a day off, but we decided to hold a meeting to review the project's progress and evolution. We shared ideas and advancements to ensure everyone on the team was on the same page. Additionally, we made the decision to allow the system to easily train new models and use different sign language models, avoiding limitation to the default Mexican sign language.</td>
  <td>we decided to incorporate a feature into the system that allows easy training of new models and the use of various sign language models, avoiding confinement to the default Mexican sign language.</td>

  <td>8 Nov (The last meeting)   </td>
  <td>We had a one-hour meeting with the professor during which we discussed our ideas and progress. He advised us to focus on the most essential aspects and prompted us to question the feasibility of our initial plans within the given timeframe. As a result, we decided to pivot Arjé's purpose. Instead of being a translator, it will evolve into a sign language alphabet trainer.</td>
  <td>
Following the professor's advice, we'll prioritize essential aspects, reassess the feasibility of our initial plans, transition Arjé from a translator to a sign language alphabet trainer, implement necessary changes, and document the decision-making process for clarity and reference.</td>
