## Generic Competences
* We held meetings once or twice a week to discuss the project's evolution and plan the development roadmap for the following days.

* Throughout the project development, we worked as a team, employing diverse organizational techniques and applications (Notion, Jamboard, Github Issues, etc.) to ensure proper communication and cooperation.

* We efficiently and effectively worked under pressure to deliver results while fulfilling our other academic responsibilities.

## Disciplinary Competences
* We encountered several issues that required solving by applying our knowledge of computational systems and designing efficient algorithms to accomplish the tasks at hand. Among these, we would like to highlight compatibility issues among different operating systems and data transfer between programming languages.

## Specific Competences
* We applied the object-oriented programming paradigm in C# for the project's development.

* We created reusable code components capable of interfacing with any AI model trained correctly using the arje-SignTrainer app.

* While developing the final version of the project, we utilized the MVC design pattern. Additionally, we tested various design patterns during the process, primarily MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), which was employed in creating the initial non-functional version of the UI.

* The models trained with the arje-SignTrainer app are stored on the users' computers and persist during different sessions on the arje-SignPractice app.

## Constructive Critique
The object-oriented programming class has some really good parts we should highlight. It encourages students to learn on their own and take the initiative, which helps them develop skills they'll need for their future jobs. Teaching practical skills that we can actually use at work makes the course super valuable. It feels like we're in a real work setting which makes learning more real and practical.

However, the self learning focus of the course can make it very easy to fall behind for students who don't stay involved all the time. Also, the class happens during a really busy semester (this is more of a circumstantial issue but we thought it was worth mentioning), so it's hard to keep up with everything, especially because there's a lot of time between each project increment. This timing sometimes makes it tough to stay involved and finish tasks on time. Balancing the self-learning emphasis with more structured, regular milestones might alleviate these challenges and enhance the overall learning experience.
